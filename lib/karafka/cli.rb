# This is kinda trick - since we don't have a autoload and other magic stuff
# like Rails does, so instead this method allows us to exist with exitcode 10
# then our wrapping process (outside of irb) detects this, it will restart the
# console with new code loaded
# Yes we know that it is not turbofast, however it is turbo convinient and small
#
# Also - the KARAFKA_CONSOLE is used to detect that we're executing the irb session
# so this method is only available when the Karafka console is running
if ENV['KARAFKA_CONSOLE']
  # Reloads Karafka irb console session
  def reload!
    puts "Reloading...\n"
    Kernel.exit 10
