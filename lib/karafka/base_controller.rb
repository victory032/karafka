# Karafka module namespace
module Karafka
  # Base controller from which all Karafka controllers should inherit
  # Similar to Rails controllers we can define before_schedule callbacks
  # that will be executed
  # Note that if before_schedule return false, the chain will be stopped and
  # the perform method won't be executed in sidekiq (won't peform_async it)
  # @example Create simple controller
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     self.group = :kafka_group_name
  #     self.topic = :kafka_topic
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a block before_schedule
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     self.group = :kafka_group_name
  #     self.topic = :kafka_topic
  #
  #     before_schedule do
  #       # Here we should have some checking logic
  #       # If false is returned, won't schedule a perform action
  #     end
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a method before_schedule
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     self.group = :kafka_group_name
  #     self.topic = :kafka_topic
  #
  #     before_schedule :before_method
